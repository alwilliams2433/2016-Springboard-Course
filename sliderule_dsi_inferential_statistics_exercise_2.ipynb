    "### Examining racial discrimination in the US job market\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Background\n",
    "Racial discrimination continues to be pervasive in cultures throughout the world. Researchers examined the level of racial discrimination in the United States labor market by randomly assigning identical résumés black-sounding or white-sounding names and observing the impact on requests for interviews from employers.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Data\n",
    "In the dataset provided, each row represents a resume. The 'race' column has two values, 'b' and 'w', indicating black-sounding and white-sounding. The column 'call' has two values, 1 and 0, indicating whether the resume received a call from employers or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the 'b' and 'w' values in race are assigned randomly to the resumes.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Exercise\n",
    "You will perform a statistical analysis to establish whether race has a significant impact on the rate of callbacks for resumes.\n",

    "   2. What are the null and alternate hypotheses?\n",

    "A z-test is the most appropriate choice for this problem. This is because the central limit theorem does apply to this problem because the theorem states that the sum of a large number of independent, identically distributed variables will be approximately normal, **regardless of the underlying distribution** (even binomial distributions).\n",

To test between these two possibilities, we can construct a null distribution where the percentage of callblacks is blind to race. We find that the base probability of a callbacks (independent of race) is:"
