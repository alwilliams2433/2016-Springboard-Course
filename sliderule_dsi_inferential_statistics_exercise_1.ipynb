    "## What is the true normal human body temperature? \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Background\n",
    "\n",
    "The mean normal body temperature was held to be 37$^{\\circ}$C or 98.6$^{\\circ}$F for more than 120 years since it was first conceptualized and reported by Carl Wunderlich in a famous 1868 book. In 1992, this value was revised to 36.8$^{\\circ}$C or 98.2$^{\\circ}$F. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Exercise\n",
    "In this exercise, you will analyze a dataset of human body temperatures and employ the concepts of hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, and statistical significance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer the following questions **in this notebook below and submit to your Github account**. \n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Is the distribution of body temperatures normal? \n",
    "    - Remember that this is a condition for the CLT, and hence the statistical tests we are using, to apply. \n",
    "2.  Is the true population mean really 98.6 degrees F?\n",
    "    - Bring out the one sample hypothesis test! In this situation, is it approriate to apply a z-test or a t-test? How will the result be different?\n",
    "3.  At what temperature should we consider someone's temperature to be \"abnormal\"?\n",
    "    - Start by computing the margin of error and confidence interval.\n",
    "4.  Is there a significant difference between males and females in normal temperature?\n",
    "    - Set up and solve for a two sample hypothesis testing.\n",

The null hypothesis in both of these tests is a normal distribution. Because the p-values for both statistical tests are greater than 0.05, we can safely conclude that the temperature dataset does not deviate from a normal distribution."

A one-sample t-test is more appropriate here than a one-sample z-test because the true population standard deviation is unknown. We only know about our sample standard deviation, sample mean, and a putative population mean. \n",

    "Although it would be incorrect, we could perform a z-test where our null distribution is drawn from our samples (mean and standard deviation) and then test whether 98.6 degrees F significantly differs from this \"population.\" However, if we did setup such a z-test, we would find that 98.6 degrees does not significantly differ from the null distribution. This is because a value of Z=0.48 is less than the critical value of 1.96 required to achieve statistical significance (i.e. p<0.05 for a two-tailed test)."
