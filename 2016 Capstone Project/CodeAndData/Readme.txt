The project was done such that the analysisMasterScript.py is the main function I used for analysis in this capstone project. The main function depends upon the following helper packages are:
• capstoneProjectFunctions.py
• part1_Functions.py
• part2_Functions.py
• part3_Functions.py

If you do not want to reload the data from scratch, you need to use the following *.csv files:
• BinnedCorrelations_NoZScore.zip
• BinnedData_NoZScore.zip
• CorrelationExtrema_NoZScore.csv
• LocalCorrelationData_NoZScore.zip
• MarketCapData_NASDAQ.csv
• NASDAQList.csv
• stockData_NoZScore.zip
All of the *.zip files contain a compressed *.csv file, which needs to be extracted into the main directory. They were compressed because of GitHub’s 25MB limit.
